I aimed for sort of a [U.S. highway sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_the_United_States) look. I use the [Overpass](https://overpassfont.org/) (header) and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) (body) fonts; and the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color scheme (plus highway colors!)
{% note() %}
In fact, there's no federal specification for road sign colors apart from general descriptors like "reflective green".

I take (heavy) inspiration from my good friend Tanay Biradar's [amazing website](https://tanaybiradar.com/)â€”check out his work!
