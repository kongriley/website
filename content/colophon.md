This site was generated using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

I aimed for sort of a [U.S. highway sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_the_United_States) look. I use the [Overpass](https://overpassfont.org/) (header) and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) (body) fonts; and the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color scheme (plus highway colors!)
{% note() %}
In the process of selecting colors for this site, I was reminded that color is weird! The [federal specification for traffic colors](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno-colorspec.htm) is a fascinating read about the variety of parameters sign colors can take on.

I take (heavy) inspiration from my good friend Tanay Biradar's [amazing website](https://tanaybiradar.com/)â€”check out his work!
