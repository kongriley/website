I take pleasure in writing. I'm pretty bad at it. 

It's one thing to produce words, but it's another to refine your writing to truly convey a message. And it's another skill altogether to craft clear prose on the first try.

Writing itself is hard. Putting pen to paper is unbearably slow, and so is typing; I've tried using things like [speech to text dictation](https://superwhisper.com/), but it feels unnatural. It takes a certain amount of courage to actually commit to what you want to say. 

I read the writings of [people](https://stephango.com/) [I admire](https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/), and wow, they're *good*. They have a real voice; I know what they're getting at. As for me, I don't really know what I'm getting at when I write. Might it be the way I approach writing? There's a difference between writing to impress people and writing to teach something to people. But on this blog, I want to do neither and both at the same time. To shout into my surroundings, even if that's the void.

I know that writing—like any skill—can be improved over time, but before that I have to be bad at it. Maybe, in the near future, I'll come back to this post, cringe at it, and write an updated version, singing my own praises.
