- i've listened to christmas music every december of my life
- koit 96.5 plays it every year between thanksgiving and christmas
	- that's the only thing playing in the car in that time period
- i like it, i know the words to basically all songs, i can identify the artist and album name

* taste the bitterness of the passage of time
	* and it receddes but in fleeting moments you're unprotected against the scariness of nostalgia
* it feels comforting, it feels scary
