i was going to write a blog on the first day of 2024. now we're halfway done with 2024.

I don't know how to take agency, but it's killing my life.

Last semester, I took a linguistics class which was all about agency (more specifically, agenthood in ergativity). Did you know that many languages have a system where the difference between "I fell (accidentally)" and "I fell (intentionally)" is baked into the grammar?
Did you know that this line of thinking is so pervasive that we believe now that regardless of how grammar forms, the agent gets introduced in a specical position? 
- If you think about it, this makes sense.

I find myself in the passive a lot, this happened to me, I don't know how to proceed.

hard to do things, and muscle my way into good places

in my first two years i fell into a pit
- befor ethat i had a goal, if a vague one: get into a good college. this meant doing so many little optimizations
- when i got into college i realized:
	- nothing matters that i thought would, and so much more does
	- the world is so unoptimizable
	- i didn't have people breathing down my back (i'm really grateful for this tho), so now i don't really know what to do
	- i was optimizing for maximum pleasure of those around me
- i'm still in this pit imo, 
- maybe it wasn't a pit but it was simply that the stage lights turned on and i was caught naked, that the training wheels of high school were ripped right off and now i'm learning about all the little ways cracked people push themselves to be better, and something within me instinctively rejected this. like i wasn't allowed to be doing things liek that, i can't do public speaking, i can't network, xyz.
- behind this i'm deeply afraid that i'll be unsatisfied and working so hard for so little pay, and i want to have the freedom to financially support my whole family

- people who ahve the luxury to do what they really wnat to do


anyways, this was a semi-coherent rambling
