What's the point of linguistics?

[[ergativity notes]]

Generative view
- Organizing phenomena of languages that seem to occur in parallel
	- Doing so in a generalizable way (one we can make predictions from)
- Characterizing all languages as different parameter settings of one big "model"
- Deriving highly non-intuitive understandings of language
	- eg. (left periphery) why do most languages do SVO / SOV?
		- ordering of topic
	- eg. why can we say "the boat was sunk deliberately" but not "the boat was sunk (wait bad example)"
	- eg. why do we have to say "i ate an/the apple" or "i ate apples" but not just "i ate apple"?
