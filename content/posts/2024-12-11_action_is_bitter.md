* just do it
* all actions are hard
* thinking about motivation
  * i wish there was a magic pill or a series of incantations that would give me motivation
  * that would allow me to do my work pain-free
  * "i just can't get up in the morning, go to bed at night"
* but there's no way around it
  * the earlier you learn this truth, the easier it gets
* you can't dwell on the bitterness but rather have to accept it
* upside: the aftertaste is sweet

* it's a marathon
	* i would procrastinate -> do everything right before the deadline
	* this is like entering a food eating contest, sitting there for 5 minutes, and then stuffing 50 hot dogs simultaneously
	* obviously it would feel like the world's hardest task
	* but it doesn't have to be this way, as long as you are persistent
	* and it's easy and manageable if you do things one at a time
