title = "Action is bitter"
+++

* just do it
* all actions are hard
* thinking about motivation
  * i wish there was a magic pill or a series of incantations that would give me motivation
  * that would allow me to do my work pain-free
  * "i just can't get up in the morning, go to bed at night"
* but there's no way around it
  * the earlier you learn this truth, the easier it gets
* you can't dwell on the bitterness but rather have to accept it
* upside: the aftertaste is sweet
