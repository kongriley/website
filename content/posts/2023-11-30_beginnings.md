> In the beginning...

I created [the repo](https://github.com/kongriley/website) for this page a year ago, on Christmas Day 2023, and I've only just now begun to bring it to a publishable state. It's a testament to how difficult it is to start something, because it's only a year later that I've actually started to complete this.

I ask myself: Why are beginnings so difficult? Starting any project always gives me a sense of dread. Fundamentally, I think that my modus operandi is that of trying to remove *discomfort* from my life. You see at once the immensity of the task you have set in front of you, and you have no way of easing this tension immediately. So the larger, the more meaningful, the project is, the more discomfort you endure in the beginning.
